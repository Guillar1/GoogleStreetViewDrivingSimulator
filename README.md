# Google Street View Driving Simulator

This Python program will generate a timelapse of a Google Streetview drive between two destinations. It is like being in the driver seat of
a Google Streetview car. It can also focus on a given place by given it it's coordinates and height. It is currently multithreaded, as it makes it
faster to fetch the images from the API. You can give the location in any format that the Google Directions API will be able to accept.
